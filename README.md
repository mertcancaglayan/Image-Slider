## Features

The script includes a sliding carousel based on mouse movement and scrolling the mouse wheel. It allows zooming in on the element being clicked and slides the element if it's not in the middle.

### Image Gallery Initialization

The script dynamically generates an image gallery by appending image elements to the specified HTML container with the id "imageGallery." The images are sourced from the "images" folder and are displayed in a grid.
